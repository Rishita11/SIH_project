# OBJECTIVE

There is a need to develop an engaging, supportive alumni network, which is critical to the success of an institution/organization. There is currently no mechanism in place for the Directorate to keep track of the trainees who graduate year after year.

# INTRODUCTION

We are attempting to address the issue of tracking and helping alumni graduating year by year  through a unique collaborative website, "Alumni Hub," which will connect different Alumni from various institutes of India . Currently there are alumni portals of different universities but there is no such national level portal which can connect the alumni from the different MSDE institutes of India. Besides, we do not have a portal connecting the alumni with the recruiting industries. The portal allows alumni to create accounts and update their job profiles. Aside from that, we've included a feature that will help MSDE and NSTI institutes keep track of the trainees graduating year by year and allow the National Skill Training Institute (NSTI) and other industries to recruit people by viewing their profiles.We've included a number of features, including:
1) Group Chat feature
2) Announcements and Posts
3) Job Hunting/posting
4) Calendar of Events

# WORKFLOW:

When a user visits our Home Page, they will see the following two options:
1.	Register as an alumni.
2.	Log in as an NSTI administrator/Industry Administrator.

If the user selects "Login as alumni," they will be redirected to a page where they will be asked to "Sign in" with their username and password, and if they do not have an account, they can create one by filling out the following information:
●	Personal data – name, email address, phone number, gender
●	College-related information, such as the name of the institute, the year of graduation, the course name, the branch name, the college registration number/roll number, and so on.
●	 Login ID and Password
●	Job profile- the name of the company for which they work, the date they started, and so on.
●	Work Experience

Their information will be saved in our database. This information will then be forwarded to the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) for verification. This could take up to two days. When this is completed, the user will be notified via email.

If the user selects the second option, "Login as NSTI administrator/ Industry Admin," they will be redirected to a page with information about alumni and their job descriptions. They can post job openings, search alumni by college and year of graduation, and send direct messages or emails regarding upcoming opportunities.

# NOVELTY

The “Alumni Hub” portal is a unique collaborative website, which will connect different Alumni from various institutes of India . Currently there are alumni portals of different universities but there is no such national level portal which can connect the alumni from the different MSDE institutes of India along with that connect them to various industry leaders and NSTI institutes .

# FEATURES

After Login, the alumni will be redirected to the Activity Dashboard, where he can track his activities and use the following features :
●	Group Chat :
         Today, online chatting is much more than a means to maintain personal connections. Online group chats offer a platform to share, collaborate, discuss, and innovate. By including a group chat feature in our website, there will be no dependence on third-party platforms. Users can communicate with each other, share opinions, and discuss products and services of common interest. As a result, there will be a significant boost in engagement and user retention.

●	Posts and Announcements :
         In this section users can share news about their recent award, achievements or certification , promote an upcoming event or webinar, highlight a recently released product/technology or Feature a recent portfolio or case study addition.

●	Search for jobs : 
         This section serves as the modern equivalent of classified ads by compiling and listing available telecommuter and local openings. It will be one of the most efficient ways to search for and apply to dozens of opportunities for users. Users can search by job title and location, salary range, date posted, and experience level. Also, it can help employers pace up their hiring process. It would be easier for recruiters or hiring managers to verify job applications online than physically scan printed resumes. 

●	Event Calendar:
  	A calendar provides an easy way to digest information and discover events they want to attend. A calendar opens up a new world of valuable metrics and insight, from ticket data to your user’s email addresses and contact information. We will even integrate our calendar with email marketing efforts and automate email announcements, registration reminders, and follow-ups. 

Whereas once NSTI admin or any Industry Administrator Logins to the portal, they will be able to access and use the following features :
